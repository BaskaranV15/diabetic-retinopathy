## DIABETIC RETINOPATHY USING CNN
A machine learning-based system that detects and classifies Diabetic Retinopathy using CNN and VGG16. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis and reduce the risk of blindness by providing a highly accurate and efficient diagnostic tool.

## About
Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes that affects the retina's blood vessels. This project leverages advanced deep learning algorithms to detect its presence and severity from retinal images. By employing VGG16 and CNN models, the system ensures accurate detection and grading, enabling timely treatment.

## Features
- **Automated Detection:** Uses pre-trained VGG16 and CNN models for precise image analysis.
- **Prediction and Classification:** Accurately identifies and categorizes disease severity.
- **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload retinal images for analysis.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for personalized access.
- **Model Integration:** A Flask API integrates the deep learning model with the front end.


## Usage

1. **Register an Account:** Navigate to the registration page and create a new account.
2. **Log In:** Use your credentials to log in.
3. **Upload an Image:** Go to the upload section and submit a retinal image.
4. **View Results:** The system will analyze the image and display the results.
